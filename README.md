<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ü§©ü§©About The Projectü§©ü§©

<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63441472/221376076-b5807660-1f6f-4e8f-8f20-27afd96658d1.mp4>

### üí≠Inspiration

- Currently, Data in centralized systems is at the risk of being easily **tampered/modified** as there is a single entity(central authority) which is controlling them. For example , FIR copies being tampered/deleted or bank information altered by misusers or post morterm reports manipulated , etc.
- To solve this problem , we came up with a solution using **blockchain**.
- <H4>Usecase :In law enforcement</H4>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  In the field of law enforcement , it is seen that crucial informations like FIR reports , Post-mortem reports are often **illegally tampered** , by influence or power , to favour a certain side. We can prevent this by using blockchain technology , which is immutable and non-destructable.

- <H4>Another Usecase :In banking</H4>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of banking and their servers are centeralized. This , however unwillingly , gives them supreme authority over our data, including access to our account balance , cheque details , money transfers , etc. Servers are prone to hacking or other data breach issues , also , the centeralized company might not be very trustworthy with our data. This issue is also valid for businesses of all scale.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Blockchain (One of the ways to implement decentralization)** steps into the picture to solve our problems.

### üí°What problem does the project solve?

- The project aims to solve the problem of **information manipulation** in public and private sectors.
- The **DAPP** helps us to create **customizable** ledgers (records) that are stored in **decentralised blockchain** networks.
- Ledged also allows us to upload files using **FileCoin** IPFS
- It also enables the user to systematically preview the past ledgers
- This makes it immune to tampering or manipulation.

- **Transparency** of data is maintained.

### üôåOverview

- In The landing Page, the user will be able to see features of our DAPP and also get started with our ledger
- After clicking the **get started** button , the login happens using **Metamask** wallet
- The user is redirected to their **profile page** , where they can view their **past ledgers** or **create new ledgers**
- At New Ledger page , user can create their **custom fields and data** , and also upload **files**
- They are also allowed to preview the file in the **preview section** before finally clicking **Deploy**
- The previously created ledgers can be viewed under Previous Ledgers page.

### üíÄ Challenges we ran into

- Since blockchain is fairly new technology , we were finding it difficult to get solutions of out bugs due to smaller community.
- In the solidity file , i was using a struct of my own , but due to lack of resources , we faced problems initially.
- A very recent and major update of **Ether JS** made it very confusing , and we had to go through a lot of documentations

### üîÆ What's Next For Our Project

- Restructuring the view-ledger section for better readibility and better organization
- Optimization and minor bug fixes
